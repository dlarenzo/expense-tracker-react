# INSTRUCTIONS TO GET YOU STARTED

Download file from github repository

Inside your IDE pull up terminals, one for frontend folder named client and another for the backend folder named api.

Navigate to the client folder and run npm i to install all the dependencies. In other terminal navigate to the api folder and run npm i to install dependencies.

Now that you have a terminal for client and a terminal for api you will need to run your frontend (client) and your backend (api) in the terminals

# RUN FRONTEND (CLIENT)

In the terminal where you are in client folder run this command:
npm start

Then in your internet browser copy the http localhost information and place in browser
Or you can hold down cmd and then click it to automatically open in a browser

# RUN BACKEND (API)

In the terminal where you are in api folder run this command:
npm run server

# TEST SIGN IN ON THE LOCALHOST ON IN THE BROWSER

Once the page appears you can try the email and password provided

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
